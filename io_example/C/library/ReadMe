This directory includes all the files necessary for building a library providing io routines for halo and subhalo catalogues. 

Directories:
gadget_io: snapshot and halo catalogues io routines for gadget data format
JING_io: same as above, for the 1024^3 series simualtion,including 611*,612*
param:parameter files for different simulations
history_io: io routines for subhalo histories

Files:
*.c,*.h: files for reading subhalo catalogues
Makefile.*: io library makefile for different simulations

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the library for a particular simulation, make sure you have the correct path set in para/param$RUN_NUM.h,

1. edit Makefile.runs, set the correct RUN_NUM and IODIR

2. clear object files from previous make:

	make clean

3. then issue the following command to produce a library file "lib$(RUN_NUM)io.a":

	make
   
   This will give you both the subcat io-library "lib$(RUN_NUM)io.a" and the history library "libhistio.a"
   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To link your program against the io libraries, include the following header files in your  source code:

datatypes.h
intra_vars.h 
iovars.h
proto.h
history_vars.h
history_proto.h

Then compile and link with

CFLAGS=-include $(PARAM) -I library -I library/$(IODIR) -I library/history
LDFLAGS=-openmp $(FTNLIB) -L library -l$(RUN_NUM)io -L library -lhistio

The variables $(PARAM) $(IODIR) $(FTNLIB) and $(RUN_NUM) are defined in "Makefile.runs".

A sample program loadview.c which loads all the data for a given snapshot is provided with Makefile in the upper directory.
load_virial.c loads the virial mass and virial radius
load_history.c loads the subhalo merger history
